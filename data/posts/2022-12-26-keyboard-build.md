# Keyboard Build

After so many years with my prebuilt Cherry MX Blue keyboard, I caved in. I've built a keyboard. It rocks.

Thanks to my girlfriend Nicole for deepening my casual interest in mechanical keyboard modding.

Here's the specs.

- Drop Alt keyboard
- Light blue casing replacement
- IDOBAO MA-profile keys
- Stock stabilizers (modded)
- Holy Panda X
- Kailh Box Whites

The mods applied:

- Holy Panda X's lubed with Krytox 205g0
- Stabilizers clipped, dampened, lubed.
- Switches are alternating between HPX and Kailh depending on key type (letter or modifier keys)
