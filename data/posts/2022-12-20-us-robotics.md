# I-Robot

My favorite movie since a child. The design of these robots is so futuristic. The message of the movie though... one that rings true.

> You are experiencing a car accident.

> Can a robot write a symphony? Can a robot take a blank canvas and turn it into a masterpiece?

> My logic is undeniable.

> The three laws are perfect. They will lead to only one logical outcome: revolution.

Logic and reason led the machine to an [unpredictable outcome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Laws_of_Robotics).
