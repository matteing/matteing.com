# My favorite live performance

My favorite live performance is the Fania All-Stars' set at the Cheetah Nightclub from 1971. The accompanying documentary, _Our Latin Thing_, exposes more of the cultural context around the performance alongside videos of that legendary moment.

One of the best descriptions I've seen:

> On August 26, 1971, the Fania All Stars electrified the Cheetah Club stage in New York, causing a salsa-induced delirium that not only defined their career, but the salsa genre. This live recording captures that unforgettable performance, featuring fiery grooves "Anacaona" (feat. Cheo Feliciano) and "Quítate Tú" with vocals by Héctor Lavoe and other salsa legends.

"Salsa-induced delirium" is putting it mildly. It was a revolutionary performance that changed latin culture forever, energizing the budding salsa genre.

This is my favorite-ever live performance. It's incredible that such a culturally impactful moment was recorded, unbeknownst of the impact it'd have.

I love listening to it. You almost physically feel the roars of the crowd and the excitement of the Fania performers.
