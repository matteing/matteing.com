# Breathe

> The roar that lies on the other side of silence
>
> The forest fire that is fear so deny it
>
> Walk out into the street
>
> Sing your heart out
>
> The people we meet
>
> Will not be drowned out
>
> There's nothing you have that I need
>
> I can breathe
>
> Breathe now
>
> We are people borne of sound
>
> The songs are in our eyes
>
> Gonna wear them like a crown
>
> Walk out, into the sunburst street
>
> Sing your heart out, sing my heart out
>
> I've found grace inside a sound
>
> I found grace, it's all that I found...
>
> And I can breathe,
>
> Breathe now.
